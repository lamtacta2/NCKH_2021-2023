# Digital Twin For Robot Arm 2 Dof

This repository presents a conceptual about digital copies of robot arm 2 dof. The data of physical and virtual robot is transmitted bidirectionally in real time. That helps virtual robots and real robots to be synchronized with each other. 

The system uses technologies and platforms including: Unity 3D, IOT, ROS, MongoDB, Solidwords, Blender, Revit.

This conceptual is applicable to all physical systems as long as you can collect data from them.
